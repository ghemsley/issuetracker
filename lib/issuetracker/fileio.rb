  class FileIO
    # This class allows converting a hash to a pretty-printed JSON format and then writing it to a file,
    # or it can read JSON from a file and convert that JSON directly to a valid ruby hash object.
    # It requires a hash and a path as input. The hash parameter defaults to an empty hash,
    # but it should usually be called with a hash provided as an argument.
    # The path defaults to a file called .issuetracker in the user's home directory, but this can
    # optionally be overriden to specify a custom path to read or write from.
    # While the class can be instantiated with a path or not (in which case the default will be used),
    # the methods can have that initial path be overridden by passing a new path in when the method is called.
