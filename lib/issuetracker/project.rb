module Issuetracker
  # This class creates a new project with default values that can be overridden when instantiated with .new
  # It has methods for getting and setting the values of all its attributes, the setter methods for everything but @hash
  # will automatically update the hash
  # Hash can be accessed using the .hash method, and can be modified directly with the .hash method too (project.hash = {key1: 'value1'}
  # or project.hash['key'] = 'value')
  # It is recommended not to use the .hash method to update the hash unless really necessary though
  # as this won't update the other instance variables. Use the setter methods that are defined already
  # instead when possible as this updates both the variable and hash at once
  # the 'addissue' methods are special as it doesn't overwrite the @issues variable, instead it adds/removes a key to or from
  # the @issues hash then appends the @issues hash to project.hash automatically, attempting to update the issue numbers if necessary.
